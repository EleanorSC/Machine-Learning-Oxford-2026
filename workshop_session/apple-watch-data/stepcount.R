# Analyse steps data from my apple watch
# Ideas:
# Find out how many steps I do a day on average
# Find out if there's a relationship with time of year, eg. less active in winter more active in summer
# Find out if there's a relationship with the day, eg. weekday or weekend
# Find out when during the day am I usually most active

# Explore missing data, could my results be biased because I don't wear my apple watch at certain times in the day?
# Also need to find out what sets the intervals in data collection when I am wearing my apple watch, as i dont think it's every minute...
